General Idea about the TMD:
	"A place where financial stability is earned thoruhg education and hard work. They see America as a place in which the individual has some influence over his living situations."
Summary:
	The resource talks about a fiction novel called: "Once in a Promised Land" It tell us about how the incident of the 9-11 changed Arab people, about their meaning of the TAD. It's a story that starts with the protagonist having everything that someone could determine as "Accomplished the dream" but after the attack everything changed, they suffer from discrimination, racism and prejudice because they were Arab and Muslim people. In the end their life reach a turning point despite that they weren't part of the attack.
